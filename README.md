## Code for the project Advice Generator (has TWO main.js files)

This is a private repo because we want our students to write the code themselves as much as possible. Only the coaches have access to private repos in this GitHub organisation.

The code in this repo contains two example solutions: main.js and main2.js. The first one is the simple project with vanilla JavaScript and hard coded advice in an array. The main2.js is the code for working with the advice API.

Suggestions are always welcome (henriette@migracode.org).
